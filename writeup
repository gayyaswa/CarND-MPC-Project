# Implementation
## The Model Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators and update equations.

The MPC implementation is based on Kinematic model discussed in the lessons and it ignores certain parameters such as tire forces gravity and mass which makes it track the vehicle faster in comparison with complicated dynamic models. The Kinematic model equations below from the lesson explains each of the parameters involved in detail
